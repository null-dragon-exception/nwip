paramount_chiefdom: "Paramount Chiefdom"
paramount_chiefdom_desc: "Kinship and councils endure, but a single paramountcy binds lesser rulers into one realm. Expansion can proceed through tributary submission, decisive conquest, or the planting of new settlements—after which domains are woven into the center at our pace."
